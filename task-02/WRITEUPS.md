# MY APPROACH TO SOLVING THE TERMINAL CHAOS CHALLENGE
The challenge started with the onset of an impending sandstorm, to escape this I had to go the Eolian caves, with the help of the ‘cd’ command.In the Eolian caves i used the ‘ls’ command to see its contents.Over there i found a parchment which contained the code that would be used later, the contents of the parchment was accessed with the help of the ‘cat’ command.

The second part of the challenge involved exploring ‘The Light Realm’, this was done with the ‘git checkout’ command(You can check if you are in the correct branch with the 'git branch' command). In this branch, I encountered Kharnok the Bloodforged, a malevolent entity shrouded in the icy depths of Arrakis-Dex. To disarm Kharnok I had to find a spell, this was the most challenging all the other tasks.It took me multiple attempts to find this spell, but with this spell I disarmed Kharnok and found another code that was used later in the challenge.

In third part of this challenge, you enter the Dark Realm.The Dark Realm is split into two parts, the Dark Realm I and II.I used the Celestial Veil Amulet to unlock the chests in this realm, and i found two codes which was used later in this challenge.

The fourth part of this challenge involved combining all the four codes we found and using base64(I used an online decoder) to decode this, here you will get a link to the GodSuite repo(https://github.com/amansxcalibur/Terminal-Chaos-GodSuite),where further instructions were listed.

From the GodSuite repo you go to the To the stars and realms unseen repo(https://github.com/angrezichatterbox/To-the-stars-and-realms-unseen) here further instructions were listed.Once you clone this repo and run the python file ‘victory.py’ you get the final output, which is a message saying that you have successfully completed this challenge.
