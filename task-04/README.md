### These are the steps I followed while creating the bot
1. I created a python virtual environment

2. Integrated Google Books API: for fetching book data (title, description, language, preview link).

3. These are the bot commands:
   - /start: Welcome message.
   - /help: Shows all the commands.
   - /book: Request genre, return book details.
   - /preview: Request book name, provide preview link.
   - /list and /reading_list: Manage and view reading list with add/delete buttons(contains an add,delete and view option).

##### The env file contains the Telegram and Google Books API Token
This helped me understand how telegram bots work and how they are created.
