## My approach for Task-07 (Pirate's Dilemma)
I started by creating a python virtual environment
Then the modules for the CLI interface was imported
After this, I wrote a python code that once given the file name it would retrieve the IMDb ID, file and hash size, along with this the code was also supposed to scrape the Opensubtitles website.
I was able to retrieve the IMDb ID, file and hash size,but despite trying numerous times, I was unable to finish this challenge, the issue was with the web scraping, the subtitles were not being scraped from Opensubtitle website.
